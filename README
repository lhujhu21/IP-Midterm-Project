This program is an image processing program with a command-line-based user interface, with support for 7 image processing operations:
(1) Grayscale
(2) Binarize
(3) Crop
(4) Transpose
(5) Gradient
(6) Seam Carve

A number of functions are declared in two files, ppm_io.h and img_processing.h. 

In ppm_io.h:
- All ppm file processing operations included in the public repo, including ReadPPM to read in binary images, WritePPM to write out binary images, and structs for Pixel, Point, and Image.
- GetPixel: a helper function that takes a point and an image, and returns a pointer to the pixel at the x,y coordinates of the point in the image.
- Args: a defined struct type that stores the user-supplied arguments for an operation once they have been verified

In img_processing.h:
Helper Functions: 
1.  CheckArgs: helper function to check the user-provided arguments for validity and presence by storing argument values into a struct termed values based off the user-specified operation.
2.  LowerCase: helper function to remove the case-sensitivity of user-entered image processing operation
3.  CreateImage: helper function to dynamically allocate a new Image struct of a certain size
4.  MapSeams: helper function for Seam (seam carving) function that maps out the potential seams in an image and stores them in a dynamically-allocated 2D array

Image Processing Functions:
5.  Grayscale: returns an image whose pixel values are converted to grayscale
6.  Binarize: returns an image whose pixel values are binarized based on a threshold
7.  Crop: returns an image cropped to the user's specifications
8.  Transpose: returns a transposed image
9.  Gradient: returns an image where the gradient is calculated and set for each pixel
10. Seam: returns a seam-carved image
